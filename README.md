# Control System Design for a Wrist and Forearm Rehabilitative Device

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation related to the control system design for a 3-DOF hand and forearm rehabilitative device. The project aims to improve the quality of life for stroke survivors by providing effective rehabilitation for their impaired arm, focusing on relearning sensorimotor skills and enhancing functional performance.

## Motivation

Stroke is a significant global health concern, and the resulting disabilities severely affect patients' lives. Rehabilitation robots have shown promise in aiding stroke survivors through consistent and long-duration therapy. This project focuses on coordinated hand and wrist therapy to enhance the performance of daily activities.

## Key Features

- Kinematic and dynamic modeling using Denavitâ€“Hartenberg and Newton-Euler approaches.
- Inverse dynamics controller for motion control in joint space.
- Trajectory generation with trapezoidal velocity profiles.
- Grip force computation based on clinical study data.
- Flexible control system design prioritizing patient comfort.
- Evaluation metrics include joint position error, joint velocity error, and torque command analysis.
- Integration with OpenSim for inverse dynamic problem solving.
